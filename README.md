# PHP-Webinterface-MySQL

That is my first PHP Webinterface Project!

# What is that?
It's a PHP Webinterface working with MySQL Databases.
It has a complete Account System and a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) MySQL System.
The main content is a Table with all of the MySQL Data and you can edit records my clicking into the fields with inline edit!


# What have I learned from that Project?
With that Project I have learned the Server language PHP and MySQL.
Ofcourse PHP and MySQL combined, to work with the data from the database to have a well functioning webinterface.

# Why is the styling that bad?!
The priority was to learn Backend Development, so I haven't focused on CSS and I just used Bootstrap.

# If you wanna use that project for yourself, please notice that:
When using the Project, please overlook the MySQL Connections, or it won't work.
In the .sql files is the setup of the Tables for that Interface.

# Here you go!
Have fun!
